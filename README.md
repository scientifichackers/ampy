## ampy

Adafruit MicroPython Tool (ampy) - Utility to interact with a CircuitPython or MicroPython board over a serial connection.

Ampy is meant to be a simple command line tool to manipulate files and run code on a CircuitPython or
MicroPython board over its serial connection.
With ampy you can send files from your computer to the
board's file system, download files from a board to your computer, and even send a Python script
to a board to be executed.

Note that ampy by design is meant to be simple and does not support advanced interaction like a shell
or terminal to send input to a board.  Check out other MicroPython tools
like [rshell](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell)
or [mpfshell](https://github.com/wendlers/mpfshell) for more advanced interaction with boards.

## Installation

You can use ampy with either Python 2.7.x or 3.x and can install it easily from
Python's package index.  On MacOS or Linux, in a terminal run the following command (assuming
Python 3):

    pip3 install --user adafruit-ampy

On Windows, do:

    pip install adafruit-ampy

Note on some Linux and Mac OSX systems you might need to run as root with sudo:

    sudo pip3 install adafruit-ampy

If you don't have Python 3 then try using Python 2 with:

    pip install adafruit-ampy

Once installed verify you can run the ampy program and get help output:

    ampy --help

You should see usage information displayed like below:

      ampy - Adafruit MicroPython Tool
    
      Ampy is a tool to control MicroPython boards over a serial connection.
      Using ampy you can manipulate files on the board's internal filesystem and
      even run scripts.
    
    Options:
      -p, --port PORT    Name of serial port for connected board.  Can optionally
                         specify with AMPY_PORT environment variable.  [required]
    
      -b, --baud BAUD    Baud rate for the serial connection (default 115200).
                         Can optionally specify with AMPY_BAUD environment
                         variable.
    
      -d, --delay DELAY  Delay in seconds before entering RAW MODE (default 0).
                         Can optionally specify with AMPY_DELAY environment
                         variable.
    
      -v, --verbose      Print messages to monitor the progress of the requested
                         operation.
    
      --version          Show the version and exit.
      --help             Show this message and exit.
    
    Commands:
      get    Retrieve a file from the board.
      ls     List contents of a directory on the board.
      mkdir  Create a directory on the board.
      put    Put a file or folder and its contents on the board.
      reset  Perform soft reset/reboot of the board.
      rm     Remove a file from the board.
      rmdir  Forcefully remove a folder and all its children from the board.
      run    Run a script and print its output.


If you'd like to install from the Github source then use the standard Python
setup.py install (or develop mode):

    python3 setup.py install

Note to run the unit tests on Python 2 you must install the mock library:

    pip install mock

## Usage

Ampy is made to talk to a CircuitPython MicroPython board over its serial connection.  You will
need your board connected and any drivers to access it serial port installed.
Then for example to list the files on the board run a command like:

    ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART ls

You should see a list of files on the board's root directory printed to the
terminal.  Note that you'll need to change the port parameter to the name or path
to the serial port that the MicroPython board is connected to.

Other commands are available, run ampy with --help to see more information:

    ampy --help

Each subcommand has its own help, for example to see help for the ls command  run (note you
unfortunately must have a board connected and serial port specified):

    ampy --port /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART ls --help

## Configuration

For convenience you can set an `AMPY_PORT` environment variable which will be used
if the port parameter is not specified.  For example on Linux or OSX:

    export AMPY_PORT=/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART
    ampy ls

Or on Windows (untested) try the SET command:

    set AMPY_PORT=COM4
    ampy ls

Similarly, you can set `AMPY_BAUD` and `AMPY_DELAY` to control your baud rate and
the delay before entering RAW MODE.

To set these variables automatically each time you run `ampy`, copy them into a
file named `.ampy`:

```sh
# Example .ampy file
# Please fill in your own port, baud rate, and delay
AMPY_PORT=/dev/cu.wchusbserial1410
AMPY_BAUD=115200
# Fix for macOS users' "Could not enter raw repl"; try 2.0 and lower from there:
AMPY_DELAY=0.5
```

You can put the `.ampy` file in your working directory, one of its parents, or in
your home directory.
